## 2022-12 Safe Side Security Case Study
- Was using the leading industry legacy software
- Faced with a need to make a major investment in IT infrastructure to support the ongoing requirements on the legacy software, they took the opportunity to explore other options before making the investment
- After evaluating a number of options they Identified FieldHub as the best suited to their needs because it is cloud based, modern, designed specifically for their type of business, and offers excellent support for recurring billing automation, a primary requirement for their business.
- FieldHub provided a scripted import of their legacy data importing customers details, history of the customer (and their systems) service history
- FieldHub provided their team training sessions and regular check ins, with a dedicated project manager, throughout the process.
- Safe Side was actually able to save about $10K by switching to FieldHub when they did. They were going to need to invest in updated server and software licenses to support their legacy software.
- FieldHub prepared the configuration of their new FieldHub environment and performed a test import of their data for the Safe Side teams review and then, on the scheduled "cut over" date, FieldHub deployed their new cloud based operations and accounting environment.
